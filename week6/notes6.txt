We learned pathon this week.
we learned everything besides data structures and memory.
simular to psuedocode they use print, it is very simple most commands are just words
instead of a compiler we use an interpriter because it needs separate code to run
get_item is what is used instead of scanf. 
answer = get_string("What's your name?\n")
print("hello, " + answer)                                                                      
print also accepts format strings like f"hello, {answer}", which substitutes variables inside curly braces into a string.
We can create variables with just counter = 0. To increment a variable, we can use counter = counter + 1 or counter += 1.
Conditions look like:
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
elif x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
else:
    print("x is equal to y")
In Python, there are many data types:
bool, True or False
float, real numbers
int, integers
str, strings
range, sequence of numbers
list, sequence of mutable values, that we can change or add or remove
tuple, sequence of immutable values, that we can’t change
dict, collection of key/value pairs, like a hash table
set, collection of unique valuesIn Python, there are many data types:

Aside from these few differences c and pathon are very simular
The rest is example of pathon code
